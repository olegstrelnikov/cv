6 years
Virtual Instruments, Inc (former LoadDynamiX, Inc former SwiftTest, Inc)

USA, http://loaddynamix.com
Senior software engineer / team lead (outsourcing)
The lead of the command developing the following protocols and APIs for the backend firmware:
HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon, CDMI, OpenStack, Hadoop, TCP, IPv6, TLS/SSL

The Load DynamiX solution provides comprehensive storage workload modeling to enable unparalleled insight for storage architects and storage engineers. The solution supports all File, Block and Object storage protocols and comprises two primary components: Load DynamiX Enterprise and Load DynamiX Performance Validation Appliances
The Load DynamiX appliances are used to generate traffic based on workload models and access patterns that have been configured by Load DynamiX Enterprise. The appliances are purpose-built devices with a software and hardware architecture that has been specifically engineered to cost-effectively generate massive traffic loads that can test the performance and scalability limits of any storage subsystem, including the highest-end flash storage systems
The Ethernet based appliances come in a variety of configurations that currently support up to eight 1Gb Ethernet ports (1G Series Solution) or up to eight 10Gb Ethernet ports (10G Series Solution). Each appliance can be used to generate traffic for NFS, CIFS, SMB, iSCSI, HTTP, HTTPS, CDMI, or OpenStack Swift workloads
